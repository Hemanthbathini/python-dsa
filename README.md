# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice

This repository contains my daily DSA learning and problem-solving practice.  
The goal is to build strong fundamentals, improve problem-solving intuition, and maintain consistent progress.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Time & Space Complexity
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Stacks, Queues, Hashmaps
- Trees, Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Sorting & Searching
- Two-pointer, Sliding Window
- Greedy, Divide & Conquer

## 💻 Practice Platforms

- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- CodeSignal
- Personal notebook implementations

## 📌 Purpose

- Learn by doing, not just reading
- Track consistency and improvements
- Prepare for real technical interviews
- Push code often to reflect discipline and growth

> Progress over perfection. Consistency over speed. Mastery through practice.
